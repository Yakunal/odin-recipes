        <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its rich, layered structure and comforting flavors. It consists of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with layers of savory meat sauce—typically made from ground beef or pork simmered with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs—and a creamy ricotta cheese mixture, often blended with egg and Parmesan. Each layer is topped with shredded mozzarella, creating a gooey, golden crust when baked. The dish is assembled in a deep pan and baked until bubbling and golden brown, allowing the flavors to meld together beautifully. Lasagna is hearty, satisfying, and often enjoyed as a main course during family gatherings or special occasions. It can also be customized with vegetables, white sauce (béchamel), or even made vegetarian, making it a versatile and beloved comfort food around the world.
