    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza is a popular Italian dish that has become a global favorite, known for its delicious combination of a crisp, chewy crust topped with flavorful ingredients. It typically starts with a round, flat base of dough made from flour, yeast, water, and olive oil. The dough is spread with a layer of tomato sauce, then topped with cheese—most commonly mozzarella—and a variety of toppings such as pepperoni, vegetables, mushrooms, olives, or meats. The pizza is then baked in a hot oven until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly. With endless topping combinations and styles—from thin and crispy Neapolitan to deep-dish Chicago-style—pizza is incredibly versatile and can be enjoyed by nearly anyone, making it a beloved comfort food around the world.
